# Seam Carving for Content Aware Resizing
Chooses the "lowest energy" pixel in each row or column to remove as a way to hopefully render the main content in the image unchanged

To resize any image you would like:
1. Add your image to the 'images' directory
2. Update the variable 'image_name' in 'demo.m' to be the filename of your choice
3. Run 'demo.m' script in Matlab2016b or later
